## Brief Description

This is a simple React front-end application that allows a user to filter and sort data contained in a table of employees. The employee table contains the following information for each employee:

- ID number
- First Name
- Last Name
- Role
- Email Address

Using the select menu a user can filter the employee by each employee role and then reset the table back to it's original state by clicking the red reset button.

A user also has the option of sorting the table by alphabetical order (A-Z) by selecting the "A-Z" button located next the "Last Name" table header. The user can then return the table back to it's original state by clicking the "undo" icon that is directly next to the "A-Z" sort button.

The purpose of this application is to become familiar and demonstrate the basics of React such as: writing JSX, building/importing components, and setting state/using props.
